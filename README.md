# bank-customer-churn
This project aims to predict customer churn using a dataset containing 10,000 records and 18 columns. We employ various machine learning classification models, including Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extra Trees, Logistic Regression, Adaboost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and LightGBM, to identify customers who are likely to churn.
