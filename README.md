# Customer Churn Prediction Project

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using a dataset containing 10,000 records and 18 columns. The primary objective is to build machine learning classification models to identify customers who are likely to churn. The dataset used for this project is named "Customer-Churn-Records.csv."

## Dataset Description <a name="dataset-description"></a>

The dataset, "Customer-Churn-Records.csv," consists of 10,000 rows and 18 columns. Each row represents a customer, and the columns contain various attributes related to the customer's interactions with a business. The primary target variable is whether a customer churned (i.e., left the business) or not. Our goal is to build predictive models to determine which customers are likely to churn based on the provided features.

## Data Analysis <a name="data-analysis"></a>

Before diving into model building, it's essential to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset. This includes examining data distributions, identifying missing values, and visualizing relationships between features. The EDA phase helps us understand the data better and make informed decisions during preprocessing and model selection.

## Data Preprocessing <a name="data-preprocessing"></a>

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in preparing the dataset for machine learning. This phase involves tasks such as:

- Handling missing values: Imputing missing data or removing rows/columns with excessive missing values.
- Feature engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.
- Encoding categorical variables: Converting categorical data into numerical format for machine learning algorithms.
- Scaling or normalizing data: Ensuring that features are on the same scale to avoid bias in the model.

## Machine Learning Models <a name="machine-learning-models"></a>

In this project, we will explore various machine learning classification models to predict customer churn. The models used in this project include:

- Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Extra Trees
- Logistic Regression
- Adaboost
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
- LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine)

We will evaluate the performance of these models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC, among others. Model selection and hyperparameter tuning will be carried out to achieve the best possible predictive performance.
